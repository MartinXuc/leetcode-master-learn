# LeetCode Master Learn

A practice-oriented project for algorithms and data structures, mainly based on and reflecting the "Programmer Carl Algorithm Training Camp". Content is organized by chapters and daily tasks, implemented primarily in Python/C++.

## Project Content

- Covers core topics such as arrays, linked lists, hash tables, and strings, with solution write-ups and example code.
- Daily task schedules and study notes to follow the training plan step by step.
- Practice-focused: each problem includes "Idea", "Implementation", and "Post-lecture Thoughts/Summary".

## Directory Structure

- `题目文档/`: Chapter-based solutions and code (e.g., arrays, linked lists, hash tables, strings). Each problem usually has a `.md` file with the same name and example code (such as `code.YYYYMMDD.py`).
- `每日任务/`: Daily plans and link references, e.g., `day 7 哈希表 part02.md`.
- `博客文档/`: Blog-style summaries by training day.
- `代码随想录 原文/`: References and original links.
- Root examples: `demo.py`, `demo.cpp`, `README.en.md`, `LICENSE`.

## How to Use

- Start from `每日任务/`, follow the day’s plan: read the problem and reference links, then check the corresponding solution and code in `题目文档/`.
- Or learn by topic: enter a chapter in `题目文档/` and proceed sequentially.

## Run Examples

- Python: ensure Python 3 is installed, then run example code in its directory, e.g.:
  - `python 题目文档/第 3 章 哈希表篇/5. 两数之和/code.20251206.py`
- C++: use a local compiler to build and run example files, e.g.:
  - `g++ demo.cpp -std=c++17 -O2 -o demo && ./demo`

## Naming Conventions

- Code files are often named `code.YYYYMMDD.py` to indicate the date of solving.
- Documents are organized as `chapter/problem.md` for easy retrieval and review.

## Acknowledgments

- Learning resources and inspiration from "Programmer Carl" (代码随想录), extended with personal practice and reflection.
